        <h1>About Acting</h1>
        <h3>Become World's No.1 Actor</h3>
        <p>
          Acting is not about being someone different. It's finding the
          similarity in what is apparently different, then finding myself in
          there. Good acting -- real acting is impossible to spot. That's what
          makes acting so attractive. You get to break all your own rules.

        <p>
          You need supporting actors to help to tell the story. Being an actor
          whether it's supporting or leading it's important to say that actors
          can't act alone, it's impossible. What we have to do is support each
          other. I always thought the leading actor should be the best
          supporting actor, because you're the only person that can help every
          other actor on the set.

          “Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how
          cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put
          your name on it as director. Now you’re a director. Everything after
          that you’re just negotiating your budget and your fee.”
